			<h2>Burnout sucks :p</h2>
			<p><span>This</span> is what I write when I'm desperate for filler text. Text to fill the void and to fudge out some meaningless content; the same filler text that you use to just tip your English paper above the minimum word count and when you've procrastinated WAY too much for awfully stupid reasons. (Btw, feel free to ignore everything here, like I said, it's just filler text)</p> <p><span>Anyways</span>, it's been around six months since I've done any sort of project, let alone code. Burnout and other things have been really bogging me down.
			School, work, tough stuff, more school has definitely contributed, but here I am making a small thirty minute project! I've been getting a bit more enthusastic in learning about javascript, even if it's mostly review from what I've forgotten. Had to review a tad bit of HTML/CSS to get this looking alright, but I picked it back up pretty easily. If you're reading this on mobile, this probably all looks horrible since I still need to make this mobile friendly.</p> <p><span>I've</span> been messing around with a color wheel and discovered blue and yellow mix well? I don't know if whether I have bad taste in color or if it actually is a good mix, either way, I hope you like it and uh, thanks for reading all of this nonsense xD and forgive me for the bad typography, just one of many things I need to work on.</p>
